    <h1>Deforestation</h1>
    <p>Deforestation refers to the decrease in forest areas across the world that are lost for other uses such as agricultural croplands, urbanization, or mining activities. Greatly accelerated by human activities since 1960, deforestation has been negatively affecting natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and the climate. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates the annual rate of deforestation to be around 1.3 million km2 per decade.</p>

    <h3>What trees gift us, what we gift them? </h3>
    <h3>They give us life by providing oxygen, we snatch their life by cutting them. </h3>
